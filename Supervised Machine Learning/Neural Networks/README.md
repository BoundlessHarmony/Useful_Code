# Neural Networks

This folder contains Python scripts and utilities for building, training, evaluating, and tuning neural networks using popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. These scripts are designed to help you work with both simple and complex neural network architectures for tasks such as classification, regression, and more.

## Contents

- `data_preprocessing.py`: A script for preparing and normalizing data for neural network training, including encoding categorical features and splitting the data into training and test sets.
- `simple_nn.py`: A utility to build and train a simple feedforward neural network (fully connected network) for classification or regression.
- `cnn.py`: A script for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks.
- `rnn_lstm.py`: A script for building and training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers for sequence data (e.g., time series, text).
- `model_evaluation.py`: A script to evaluate the performance of neural network models, including accuracy, loss, and visualizations like confusion matrices and ROC curves.
- `hyperparameter_tuning.py`: A script for tuning the hyperparameters of neural networks using Keras Tuner or GridSearchCV.
- `model_saving_loading.py`: A utility to save and load trained models for future use or deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed. You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
