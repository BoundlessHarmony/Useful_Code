# Supervised Machine Learning

This folder contains Python scripts and utilities for building, training, evaluating, and tuning supervised machine learning models. These scripts are designed to help you apply various supervised learning algorithms for classification and regression tasks.

## Contents

- `data_preprocessing.py`: A script to preprocess data by splitting it into features (X) and target (y), handling categorical encoding, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- `linear_regression.py`: A utility for training and evaluating a Linear Regression model.
- `logistic_regression.py`: A script for performing binary classification using Logistic Regression.
- `decision_tree.py`: A script for building and evaluating Decision Tree models for classification and regression tasks.
- `random_forest.py`: A script for building a Random Forest model for classification and regression.
- `svm_classifier.py`: A utility for training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
- `model_evaluation.py`: A script for evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC for classification or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for regression.
- `hyperparameter_tuning.py`: A script for hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
