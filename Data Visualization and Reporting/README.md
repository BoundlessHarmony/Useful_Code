# Data Visualization and Reporting

This folder contains Python scripts and utilities for visualizing datasets and generating reports. These scripts will help you explore data visually, generate meaningful insights, and create professional reports that can be shared with stakeholders or used for presentations.

## Contents

- `Plot Hourly Visits`: A script for a scatter plot based on data binned into hours. Useful Xtick range generation snippet.
- `correlation_heatmap.py`: A script for generating a correlation matrix heatmap to understand relationships between features.
- `boxplot_visualization.py`: A utility to create boxplots for detecting outliers and understanding data distribution.
- `pair_plot.py`: A script to generate pair plots (scatter plots for each feature pair) to explore potential relationships in the data.
- `distribution_plot.py`: A script for visualizing the distribution of a datasetâ€™s features (e.g., KDE or histogram).
- `report_generator.py`: A script for automatically generating a data report in PDF or HTML format, which includes visualizations and basic statistics.
- `custom_dashboard.py`: A script to generate an interactive dashboard using Plotly or Dash to present dynamic reports.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use these scripts, you need to have the following Python libraries installed. You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
