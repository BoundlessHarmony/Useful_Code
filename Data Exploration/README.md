# Data Exploration and Unsupervised Machine Learning

This folder contains Python scripts and utilities for exploring datasets and applying unsupervised machine learning techniques. These scripts are useful for gaining insights from your data, understanding its structure, and applying clustering or dimensionality reduction algorithms.

## Contents

- `data_summary.py`: Provides an overview of the dataset, including basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) and data types.
- `visualization.py`: A script for generating visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and pair plots.
- `pca_analysis.py`: A utility to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
- `kmeans_clustering.py`: A script to perform K-Means clustering on a dataset and plot the clusters.
- `hierarchical_clustering.py`: A utility for performing Hierarchical Clustering and generating dendrograms.
- `elbow_method.py`: A script to use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means.
- `silhouette_analysis.py`: A script to calculate the silhouette score for evaluating clustering performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed before using the scripts. Install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
